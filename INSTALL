Granita requires Pd Vanilla with motex library
and all the patches in the provided directory (except of course the audio files
provided for testing and the screenshot)

Extract the directory to some location and open Granita.pd (alternatively
Granita64.pd or Granita32.pd)

Granita64.pd and Granita32.pd are exactly the same patch as Granita.pd but with
64 and 32 poliphony for lower resource consumption. Try these if Granita seems
to be eating all your CPU (see also README).

NOTE: On linux run pd with -rt (pdextended -rt) and set cpu to a "performance"
setup (on-demand will create audio drop)

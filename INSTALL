Granita requires PD Extended and all the patches in the provided directory (except for the wav file which is provided for testing)

Extract the directory to some location and open Granita.pd (alternatively Granita64.pd or Granita32.pd) in Pd.

Granita64.pd and Granita32.pd are exactly the same patch as Granita.pd but with 64 and 32 poliphony for lower resource consumption. Try these if Granita is eating all your CPU (see also README).

NOTE: On linux run pd with -rt (pdextended -rt) and set cpu to performance: on-demand will create audio drops:
